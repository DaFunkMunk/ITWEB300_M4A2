This assignment provided a hands-on opportunity to see the power and simplicity of jQuery when interacting with HTML elements. Compared to vanilla JavaScript, 
jQuery reduced the code complexity for handling DOM events, updating text, clearing input fields, and applying dynamic CSS changes. Setting up the click event 
handler and using .val() and .text() made it intuitive to update the form and display feedback without needing to reload the page.

One challenge was remembering the exact jQuery syntax for chaining commands and manipulating form fields cleanly. Another minor issue was ensuring that the 
hover effect didn’t need separate jQuery code, as CSS handled it more efficiently. Overall, the assignment was a great learning experience on jQuery’s practical 
use in form handling, event tracking, and real-time UI updates.
